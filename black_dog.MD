I had a black dog, his name was depression. 沮丧      <br>
whenever the black dog made an appearance I felt empty and life just seemed to slow down 出现     <br>
he could surprise me with a visit for no reason or occasion 理由      <br>
the black dog made me look and feel all over my years       <br>
when the rest of the world seemed to be enjoying life I could only see it through the black dog     <br>
activities that usually brought me pleasure suddenly sees too       <br>
he liked to ruin my appetite 胃口     <br>
he chewed up my memory, my ability to concentrate       <br>
doing anything or going anywhere with the black dog required superhuman strength        <br>
at social occasions he'd sniff 闻 out what confidence I had and chase it away        <br>
my biggest fear was being found out I worried that people would judge me because of the shame and stigma 耻辱     <br>
of the black dog I was constantly worried that I'd be found out     <br>
so I invested vast amounts of energy into covering him up keeping up an emotional lie is exhausting     <br>
black dog could make me think and say negative things       <br>
he could make me irritable 过敏的 and difficult to be around       <br>
he would take my love and bury my intimacy 性行为      <br>
he loved nothing more than to wake me up with highly repetitive and negative thinking       <br>
he also liked to remind me how exhausted I was going to be the next day     <br>
having a black dog in your life isn't so much about feeling a bit down sad or blue at its worst it's adout being devoid 缺乏      <br>
of feeling all together as I got older the black dog got bigger and he started hanging around all the time      <br>
I chase them off with whatever I thought might send him running     <br>
but more often than not he'd come out on top        <br>
going down became easier and getting up again so I became rather good at self medication which never really helped      <br>
eventually I felt totally isolated 孤立的 from everything and everyone     <br>
the black dog had finally succeeded in hijacking my life        <br>
when you lose all joy in life you can begin to question what the point of it is     <br>
thankfully this was the time that I saw a professional help this is my first step towards recovery and a major turning point in my life     <br>
I learned that it doesn't matter who you are the black dog affects millions and millions of people      <br>
it is an equal opportunity mongrel I also learned that there was no silver bullet or magic pill medication can help some and        <br>
others might need a different approach altogether       <br>
I also learned that being emotionally 情绪上 genuine 诚恳的 and authentic 真实的 to those who are close to you can be an absolute game changer       <br>
most importantly I learnt not to be afraid of the black dog and I taught him a few new tricks of my own     <br>
the more tired and stressed you are the louder will barks so it's important to learn how to quiet your mind     <br>
It's been clinically 临床的 proven that regular exercise can be as effective for treating mild 温和的 to moderate  温和的 depression as antidepressants      <br>抑郁药剂    <br>
So go for a walk or a run and leave the mutt behind     <br>
keep a mood journal, getting your thoughts on paper can be cathartic 通便的 and often insightful  有深刻见解的       <br>
also keep track of the things that you have to be greatful for      <br>
the most important thing to remember is that no matter how bad it gets      <br>
if you take the right steps, talk to the right people,black dog days can and will pass.     <br>
I wouldn't say that I'm grateful for the black dog but he has been an incredible 难以置信的 teacher.     <br>
He forced me to re-evaluate 评估 and simplify my life.        <br>
I learn that rather than running away from my problems it's better to embrace them.     <br>
The black dog may always be part of my life     <br>
But he will never be the beast that he was.     <br>
We have an understanding.       <br>
I've learnt through knowledge,patience,discipline 纪律 and humour 幽默      <br>
the worst black dog can be made to heel 脚后跟     <br>
If you are in difficulty, never be afraid to ask for help.      <br>
There is absolutely no shame in doing so        <br>
The only shame is missing out on life.      <br>
